This folder contains the Sim-to-Sim test plots, runnign the non-parallel version of the simulator (5 experiments for each action, each tool = 40 plots) over the Original Simulated Dataset. This orientation noise is always Guassian, with a standard deviation of 1, except in "Noise 0.1" and "Noise 0.5".


> Default: setting the simulator with LateralFriction = 4.32; Rolling Friction = 0.00; Mass = 0.19

> 0.25 x Lateral Friction: LateralFriction = 1.08; Rolling Friction = 0.00; Mass = 0.19

> Double Lateral Friction: LateralFriction = 8.64; Rolling Friction = 0.00; Mass = 0.19

> Double mass: LateralFriction = 4.32; Rolling Friction = 0.00; Mass = 0.38

> Half mass: LateralFriction = 4.32; Rolling Friction = 0.00; Mass = 0.095

> Noise 0.1: LateralFriction = 4.32; Rolling Friction = 0.00; Mass = 0.19; Standard deviation of orientation noise = 0.1

> Noise 0.5: LateralFriction = 4.32; Rolling Friction = 0.00; Mass = 0.19; Standard deviation of orientation noise = 0.5

> Rolling Friction 0.1: LateralFriction = 4.32; Rolling Friction = 0.10; Mass = 0.19

> Rolling Friction 1: LateralFriction = 4.32; Rolling Friction = 1.00; Mass = 0.19


Inside each folder, the plots are separated by each run (5 experiments).
