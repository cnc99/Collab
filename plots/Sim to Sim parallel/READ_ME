This folder contains plots from the Sim-to-Sim test, with the Original Simulated Dataset, setting the simulator with its real parameters: LateralFriction = 4.32; Rolling Friction = 0.00; Mass = 0.19, and varying the noise of the initial orientation.


> Default: Guassian Noise with a standard deviation of 1 to all the components of the initial orientation of the ylego.

> Test 1: Uniform Noise [-15.0, 15.0] to yaw;

> Test 2: Uniform Noise [-45.0, 45.0] to yaw;

> Test 3: Uniform Noise [-5.0, 5.0] to yaw;

> Test 4: Uniform Noise [-0.5, 0.5] to yaw;

> Test 5: Uniform Noise [-2.0, 2.0] to yaw;
