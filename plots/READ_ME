This folder contains the plots generated for the CoLab sessions 2020. To understand what each folder refers to, please consider:

 > Original Simulated Dataset: Dataset obtained from setting LateralFriction = 4.32; Rolling Friction = 0.00; Mass = 0.19; Guassian Noise with a standard deviation of 1 to all the components of the initial orientation of the ylego.

 > Simulated Dataset 2: Similar to the Original, but with uniform noise added to "yaw", with bounds [-5.0, 5.0]

 > Simulated Dataset 3: Similar to the Original, but with uniform noise added to "yaw", with bounds [-2.0, 2.0]
 
 > Simulated Dataset 4: Similar to the Original, but with uniform noise added to "yaw", with bounds [-0.5, 0.5]
 

The plots are organised in the following subfolders:

- Optimiser plots: Running the parallel version of the simulator to obtain the physical parameters of the Lateral Friction, the Mass and the Rolling Friction.
Train actions: tap from left, tap from right, push draw; Train tools: stick, rake; Test actions: tap from right; Test tools: hook; Number of experiments (each action, each tool): 20; Number of trials in the optimisation: 40; Object: ylego


- Opt to Sim: Running the parallel version of the simulator over the original simulated dataset, performing the optimisation. This test was performed to see if the optimiser converges to the physical parameters set in the simulated dataset.

- Sim to Sim Parallel: Running the parallel version of the simulator (30 experiments for each action, each tool = 240 plots) over the Original Simulated Dataset, without performing optimisation. The goal of this test was to check if we could achieve a very low cost.

- Sim to Sim Non-parallel: Runnign the non-parallel version of the simulator (5 experiments for each action, each tool = 40 plots) over the Original Simulated Dataset, without performing optimisation. The goal of this test was to check if we could achieve a very low cost.


-New simulated datasets: Contains plots from the new simulated datasets.
